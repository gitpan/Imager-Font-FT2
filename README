Imager::Font::FT2 provides font support to Imager via the FreeType 2
library.

It requires libfreetype and its development header files to be
installed.

This is currently shipped as part of Imager, but but Imager may
install with out installing Imager::Font::FT2, if your module or
application requires FreeType 2 support then add Imager::Font::FT2 as
a prerequisite.
